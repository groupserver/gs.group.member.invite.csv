  <h2>Invite a New Member</h2>
  <p>People can join groups in three ways. 
    They can <strong>join</strong> <em class="wordasword">public</em> 
    groups.
    They can <strong>request membership</strong> of
    <em class="wordasword">private</em> groups.
    Finally, you <em>must</em> <strong>invite</strong> them to join 
    <em class="wordasword">secret</em> groups; you <em>may</em>
    invite people to join
    <em class="wordasword">public</em> groups and
    <em class="wordasword">private</em> groups.
    To invite someone to join a group carry out the following tasks.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>View the page for your group.
      Log in if necessary.</li>
    <li>Select the <samp class="tab">Admin</samp> tab, and click
      <samp class="link">Enter the details of a new member</samp>.
      The <cite class="page">Invite a New Member</cite> page will be
      shown.</li>
    <li>Create the invitation.
      <p>
        The invitation is an email from you to the person that you are
        inviting.
        To create the invitation you must carry out the following.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter the email address of the person you are inviting.</li>
        <li>Write a personal message to the person you are inviting.</li>
        <li>Select the message delivery options that the recipient of
          the invitation should have <em>after</em> he or she accepts
          the invitation.</li>
        <li>Enter the details about the person you are inviting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note"><strong class="label">Note:</strong>
        It is best to make the message to the person you are 
        inviting as personal as possible.
        This will make the recipient more likely to respond, and it
        more likely that Spam filters will allow the invitation to be
        delivered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click the <samp class="button">Invite</samp> button.
      An invitation message will be sent.
      The message will include:
      <ul>
        <li>Your email address,</li>
        <li>The personal message that you wrote,</li>
        <li>Information about the group, including the number of 
          members, the frequency of posting, and the privacy of
          posts, and</li>
        <li>Information about you and your role as an administrator
          of the group.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
